# install

config your PowerShell installation before using the script

start PowerShell as admin once and type:

Set-ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" -Force

# config

open the .bat file and setup the path to the ones of your file system

-> info: make sure to enable the donwloaded modules within the BlishHud Userinterface yourself

from now on start GW2 by double clicking the .bat file (only).

nothing is more easy as adding a shortcut to your desktop to start the .bat file from there instead of your regular GW2-shortcut

# troubleshooting

if the script don't work the first time make sure:

- you did the config change in powershell under the install headline
- check the file settings of the two downloaded files: make sure the tick is set for downloaded files to be executable

if you don't make this changes the script will open and close in under 1 second
